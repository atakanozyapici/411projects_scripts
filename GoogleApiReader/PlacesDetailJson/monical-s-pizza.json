However, the Monical's on Mattis leaves much to be desired...\n\nBefore the world went crazy, if you dined in for lunch, the service was near non existent. The three or four visits that I made left me feeling as if I had somehow inconvenienced the entire staff by making the choice to spend my money there.\n\nThat's another sore spot on Monical's. While the quality is undoubtedly superior to many, the cost per square inch of delicious pizza pie is astronomical. On top of that, there is no reason for the inflation; especially considering the multitude of alternatives to choose from. \n\nTheir packaging is not travel friendly and makes it so delivery or carryout to anywhere more than 5 or so minutes from the restaurant leaves the pizza in a weird state of marbled soggy from grease soaking in and also hard where the dough has morphed into a cracker like state. \n\nAll in all, there are too many factors that steal the thunder from Monical's truly *good* pizza; perhaps this recent cataclysm for the restaurant industry provided ample opportunity for the management to teach the waitstaff how important good service is to the dining experience. That said, if you only care about a good pizza, and don't mind snobby or glassy-eyed service coupled with a not so great atmosphere and don't plan on leaving the premise with your pie - all while having more coin that Scrooge McDuck to afford the outrageous prices - then Monical's is exactly the pizza place you want to go!","time":1592358477},{"author_name":"Elan Pan","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/113239893230860876331\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/-tQMuEhAqyP4\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/IAHcxY80OKE\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5\/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Food was great, service too, but it was kind of crowded","time":1555069084},{"author_name":"Click and Shoot Studio","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/107522335983208240959\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/-YPoIbEmrjHc\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/cFJjcibkJ_o\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"Pizza and breadsticks are always a great combination here at Monicals!
