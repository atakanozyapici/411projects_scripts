Although, we haven't been inside yet, the building appears to be clean, the staff are friendly, the food is AWESOME and the service is fast!! The custard is creamy and delish! The hamburgers are served thin with crispy edges, fresh and plentiful lettuce, onions and tomatoes. Chicken strips are tender and crispy. The cheese curds and onion rings are beer battered. Thick, but light and crispy with a slight beer flavor and a sweetness that is, oh, so good! The fries are always hot and crispy. (I didn't take a photo of those) Also, ask for your burger to be made \"California style\". They add a special sauce that's also, what I suspect is their \"fry Sauce\", a thousand island dressing minus the onion and pickle peices.","time":1561137777},{"author_name":"Burke Stanion","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/104841091088682177223\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/-HuIe7EfS3to\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/JSyUSfeIwrg\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Fantastic service and excellent burgers, fries, and onion rings.

Freddy's is filling that space for a quality cheeseburger to go. And they have good custard. Today when I went through they asked if I'd like pup cups for my dogs. I love when places offer this kind of thing. Dogs get a little custard, and it makes the whole outing like a fun trip for them. I've tried quite a few things on their menu. Everything was good, though I particularly like the way they do hotdog buns. They toast them like a grilled cheese or something. It's really good. And they do a pretty good Chicago dog, even if it isn't on a poppyseed bun. ;) All and all, is recommend for anyone looking for a quality burger on the go.","time":1592418823},{"author_name":"andrew shelton","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/110790983039532126783\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/-DEZjQiBV9Jg\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/GsCguxQ_3Dw\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"Decided to try Freddy's today and it was awesome.
