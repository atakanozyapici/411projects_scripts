The last 2 times I've been there the order was incorrect.  Today I ordered a large 10 piece nugget meal and didn't receive the fries. The manager said I didn't get a meal. I showed her my receipt and said yes I did. She then checked my bag and gave me a medium fry. I told her I ordered a large. She said I only ordered a medium.  I didn't want to argue with her but when I went back to check the prices online I in fact paid for the large meal.
