I have been to Hawaii and eaten fresh poke bowls and the midwest variety does not match the freshness, but some of them come close. This is not one of them. As noted by other reviewers, the amount of protein is quite small and I don't think the fresh quality is comparable to other poke restaurants I have been to. The salmon seem to lack the crunch\/fattiness at other places. In addition, instead of the toppings, they give you excessive amounts of rice which makes it more like a rice bowl with some mild fresh fish topping the bowel. In the same line of questioning the freshness, I watched an employee put some of the salmon on and then pick it off because it was at the bottom and likely soaking in whatever liquid came from the defrosted salmon.\n\nPros: healthy lunch option available, if you like rice there is plenty\n\nCons: lower quality fish\/freshness?\n\nHidden deals:\nYou can get either free miso soup or a free bottle of water with any bowl purchase. I forgot to write down the special price deal, I believe it is a happy hour pricing that occurs with early purchase but check the sign at the front windows.","time":1555421229}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/?cid=3417998400661786659","user_ratings_total":103,"utc_offset":-300,"vicinity":"605 South 6th Street, Champaign","website":"http:\/\/www.toasttab.com\/Pokelab-Champaign"},"status":"OK"}
