The salad was incredibly fresh with generous portions. The Pad See Ewe had excellent flavor. I will note, the dumplings (not pictured) were essentially meatballs wrapped in won-ton wrappers - at $7 for 4 small, I wouldn't recommend those. \n\nSuper clean, very fast and kind service.

It had great flavor and quality ingredients. It could have been more spicy for me, but I love extremely spicy so ymmv. The restaurant was clean and new, good atmosphere, and very professional staff.

We went for lunch and picked it up to go, it took about 20 mins (we would have called ahead but we didn't have the full menu). The only thing I didn't like was the price - I spent about $20 for two regular rolls and a Thai iced tea. It was plenty of food and delicious, just a little pricey for lunch in my opinion.
