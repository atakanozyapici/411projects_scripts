What truly sets this place apart from local competitors is the service. Cassidy was so helpful and kind to our kids. My son had written a letter to them for school earlier that week so she went out to get the mail. She found his letter and read it to her employees. She then came and asked if she could take the kids on a tour of the restaurant.
