It took over 15 minutes, and after watching over 20 vehicles get their order and go around me, I got pretty annoyed. Many had much larger orders than my 3 items. Then, I finally am able to go, and guess what... wrong items. Zero paying attention and I get covid makes things harder but matching items to orders, and matching numbers is not that hard. The nearest location is almost 3 hours away so I usually like to stop when I am able. Not to this one tho.
