Seafood and southern American food are the different highlights of their menu. The bread rolls were quite good. Our server was nice even though it was her first day.

The place had one large party but not very full otherwise so it seemed they should have been able to handle it. Our orders were fixed but we did wait a long time maybe 45 minutes for our entrees. We ordered the pickle chips, cedar plank salmon, and seafood combo. All the food was decently tasty.
