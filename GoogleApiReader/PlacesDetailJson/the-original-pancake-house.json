Treated like we were truly valued the whole time we were there. My son jokingly requested a mountain of bacon; but they delivered!\n\nWe both decided to try the bacon pancakes and these are far better than anything I have ever been able to whip up at home, and the best breakfast out we've had in 2020. \n\nThe only thing left to do is count down to the next Saturday, so we can go back!
