They are very generous with their servings and the service is always very kind and quick. I would recommend the tuna poke bowl, though the salmon and tofu bowls are also excellent. Their sushi rolls are also very delicious when they are offered!\n\nI have also attended a few of the events here, including their wine tastings and private social gatherings. The venue is great for a crowd and there are different offerings to please all palates! If you have the opportunity to attend an event - public or private - don't hesitate.\n\nLunch rush is real here. While parking is a little hard on the lot, there is plenty of street parking available. Because of the several offerings inside, the lines typically move quickly, and you usually would never have a longer wait than 5-10 minutes (at most!).
