Then we had to get back in line again when they didn\u2019t hand us any straws, no napkins either. when we looked at our burgers, there\u2019s no lettuce, no onions, no tomatoes. Literally just patties and cheese. I considered turning around yet again to talk to them but my friend said it\u2019s not worth it. We\u2019re really not the kind of people to complain about anything at all, or yell at workers so I\u2019m just gonna write this instead.
