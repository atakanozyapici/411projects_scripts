We mostly recently visited for my husband\u2019s birthday. They have changed their all-you-can-eat policy to one order for the table. You can\u2019t put in multiple orders now, so if you wanted to try something to see if you liked it and wanted more, that\u2019s no longer possible. Additionally, it\u2019s much more of a gamble as they will still charge you for leftovers. \n\nThe service while we were present was unfriendly and unhelpful. We stood in the front of the restaurant for over five minutes with no line while staff stared at us before a server seated us. For a table of three, they automatically charged an 18% tip. The server absolutely did not do a good job and we would have tipped lower. He was rude and dismissive when we tried to ask questions. He wouldn\u2019t let us get a menu after we ordered to double check the rolls they brought us and argued with us that we had just messed up. \n\nThe restaurant did not observe social distancing and placed different groups at tables right next to each other. \n\nThey missed at least four rolls and three appetizers. We never got several of the things we ordered. They seemed to leave out more expensive or time consuming options, like the sashimi salad, soft shell crab, or a fried roll. For a total ticket price of over $100 with no alcohol or soda for three people (one was a child), I would expect high quality service and to receive all the food we ordered. \n\nWhen we have gone in the past with other groups, servers have missed multiple dishes as well and even served a friend raw chicken. They just took that dish away without an apology or acknowledgement or offer to bring out a fully cooked dish. \n\nWe are beyond disappointed, especially on my husband\u2019s birthday when we hadn\u2019t been out to eat for months. We will not be returning and I STRONGLY recommend no one else patronizes this restaurant.","time":1593702968},{"author_name":"Summer Case","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/107314291859275570372\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/-MGGkIoKk8xs\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/uDm5W15FXL4\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"I came to Champagne to have lunch with a friend.

Went with a friend for the all-you-can-eat. Got shown to a table, but nothing else was explained to us with regard to the ordering process. There were no drink menus either.\n\nMultiple waiters walked by our table while we had empty drink glasses in plain sight and did nothing. We also had to ask for the check, as we were unsure where to pay. Any time I got our waiter's attention, it seemed as if I was bothering him. He would ask me to repeat my requests by saying \"Huh?\" And then leave without another word. \n\nI'd advise going to Sushi Ichiban on campus instead of this place. The sushi is the same quality and price, but it's self-service with regard to drinks and everything else, and the staff is much more welcoming. \n\nService is a relatively easy area to improve in a restaurant, especially given the fact that this place seemed well-staffed. I'd go back here if I saw that things had improved, but as mentioned above, there are currently better options.","time":1581915754}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/?cid=8954239234851598328","user_ratings_total":291,"utc_offset":-300,"vicinity":"2017 South Neil Street, Champaign","website":"http:\/\/mokisushichampaign.com\/"},"status":"OK"}
