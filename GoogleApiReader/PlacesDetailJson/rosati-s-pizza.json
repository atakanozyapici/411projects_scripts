The cheese tastes rich & delicious, but the sauce & crust are so good I could eat them alone. Service is very casual counter service.  Made-to-order pizzas take awhile, but you can grab a quick slice all day.  Daily specials are worth checking out.  Stick with pizza, cheesy bread, etc.  Spaghetti here was watery & not tasty like the pizza sauce.  Also, pasta specials don't come with bread.  You have to buy it.  Unfortunately, bread is needed to absorb the watery sauce. \n\nWe still go every week for pizza.  That's probably  all we'll order from now on.","time":1576542962},{"author_name":"Daniel Loveall","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/101161702091430465954\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/-c0ADnmiy0A0\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/S1bZvyRylAw\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo\/photo.jpg","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"The pizza's here have always been great.
