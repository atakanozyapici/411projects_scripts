On nearly every occasion, we have had terrible service. Our waiters and waitresses have either completely forgotten about our table, have been rude, or have gotten our orders wrong on every visit. One time, we waited over 30 minutes to give our order and when we got our food it was completely wrong.\n\nThat said... Big Grove is a gorgeous restaurant with beautiful decor, and the ambience and hope of \"what if, this time things are different..\" keep me coming back. I really love bringing out of town guests here to check out the bar, but now we typically just get cocktails or dessert after dining at another establishment nearby. Their brunch menu is very good, and, if you can get a good waiter\/ress, it is worth the stop.","time":1594672562},{"author_name":"SPICY","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/104874332399015491514\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/-hvNyWN3je5Y\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/0fMv_OJr3N4\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"Sometimes we can\u2019t stop thinking about certain kinds of food until we\u2019ve eaten them.

It\u2019s a perfect combination of flavors and varieties, and fun to eat because of all the textures it has from the vegetables.\nSteak and truffle fries was simple but so good, perfect temp and seasoning.\nSeafood linguine pasta was something different from spicy soy chili sauce.\nGreat cocktails from knowledgeable Bartender also make this dinner even better. Try simple rum old fashion made from Diplomatico rum.","time":1579711554},{"author_name":"Brandy Emberton","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/104825119825931798009\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/-7FWqyx3AOs8\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/TPCmvUTec8Y\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Great experience today for brunch.

The vibe was good enough to eat out with my friends at Friday night, but it would be a bit loud for dating.\nThe menus are creative. I did not try that many; but I can say the taste is just good not super in general. I can recommend Mushroom Risotto. The Chicken Mole which my friend had looked interesting. \nOne down side is the price. An Entree begins at 16 and can go easily over 20 per dish.\nIf I come again, it would be because of the vibe not for the food.","time":1553994068}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["bar","restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/?cid=3448210166985862251","user_ratings_total":598,"utc_offset":-300,"vicinity":"1 East Main Street, Champaign","website":"http:\/\/www.biggrovetavern.com\/"},"status":"OK"}
