The steak came raw, and the shrimp was placed on the fries with the burger.  Called the store, little chit chat says they are slow and not getting much business today, asked to speak to the manager who on this very slow day could not talk to us at the moment, would call us back.  A few hours later we call back because they didn't, and are first told sorry, they can't do anything about a door dash issue.  Did eventually offer us a free steak next time we come in, but we wont be going back.  And how is poorly cooked food doordash's fault, last I checked they aren't cooking it when they drive it.","time":1593569434},{"author_name":"Christina Burton","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/104487708586658743225\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/-zgiGcnqeMJI\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/R5caTavgSqI\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Chrissie, our bartender tonight is so awesome.
