They try their best. Asked for moist brisket, got a flavorless and lean cut. Wife got the pulled pork and it was dry and without flavor. You should beware any BBQ place that advertises the plethora of BBQ sauces they do, it's an automatic identifier that they are covering up for failings in the meat itself. Also got the beef ribs, they were well flavored, but extremely small. I'm used to beef ribs where one beef rib weighs 3 - 5 pounds, these must have been sickly cows. Pit beans were sweet, a sacrilege for pintos. Baked potato casserole needs more salt. No kids menu.","time":1595202428},{"author_name":"Zack Stelly","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/102879276560503136045\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/-BmBECuZI2Ic\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/iMQXfAyF9GY\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Incredible burnt ends, almost melted in my mouth.
