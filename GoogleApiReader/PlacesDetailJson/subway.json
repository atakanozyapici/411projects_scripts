The toppings are perfectly placed. Just the right amount of of each ingredient. The bread? Perfectly baked. That cookie to the right? Taken out of the oven exactly when it should have been so it stays soft and chewy all day. \n\nThis is what Subway is SUPPOSED to be. Shoutout to the whole weekday daytime crew here, they're all just great at their jobs and actually make a sandwich the way a person would want it. Having worked at a Subway in the past , I'm frequently disappointed when eating at other locations because they're just not as good as the sandwiches I used to make for myself . This location lives up to that standard 100% . I once got one of my extremities stuck in a hot tub jet and was able to sue the hotel for a substantial amount of money, but even if I were a billionaire, I'd continue to frequent this location because it's just that good.","time":1577473283},{"author_name":"Berenice Lopez","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/103008334438050838650\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/-awMTXKf6IUc\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/2Ode3E7KhzA\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo\/photo.jpg","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"8 months ago","text":"I come here all the time, and 9\/10 the tables are dirty.(Close to work)  Sometimes the staff have an attitude.
