I really enjoy the decor and presentation of the location, and the sushi and food is beautiful as well.\n\nIf you'd like to eat here, know seating is very limited and you will likely be waiting for a very long time (unless you go during university breaks!). Word of note: they *do* offer takeout, and we have definitely taken advantage of that!\n\nThat said, it is one of my top three favorite restaurants in Champaign Urbana and I am always happy to wait for a table!
