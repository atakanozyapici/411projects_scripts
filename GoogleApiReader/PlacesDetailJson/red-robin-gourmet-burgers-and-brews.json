A few minutes later we were told as soon as those to tables were cleaned and put together we would be seated. In the meantime, other people came in and they were seated at those two tables! We told the manager we were leaving and he couldn't figure out why we were upset.That's my second time at this restaurant and it may be my last.","time":1583773879},{"author_name":"Lily Siu","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/105110712253862373270\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/-zCs7ha9Oi6g\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/DJLF9F2_dqg\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8\/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"A  bustling, noisy place when we visited at dinner.

Ordered for family online 445 for pickup at 530. When we got the food it was very cold like had been made right away at 445, fries were very stale as well. Their unlimited sides, in this case the side salad for me, has been turned into a miniscule container. Also missing ingredients that were ordered on burgers. When I went in to talk to staff about order there was one staff member on the phone who would not even look at you, all others gone. I left after a few minutes of being ignored. This is probably one of the few negative reviews I have made but would not recommend this location currently.","time":1588378020},{"author_name":"Jessica Leman","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/113930330481566089910\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/-cbiIqeBEVr4\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/LjiR04tNowo\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo\/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Not your typical Red Robin. We love our local red Robin in East Peoria, but had a terrible experience here. One order was never put in and one came out wrong. When we sent the order back the waiter said that the kitchen opened up the sandwich, looked through it, claimed it was correct & sent it back out when according to the menu it was clearly missing half of the toppings. We had to send the sandwich back 3 times before it came out correct (in a to go container at that point because we had to leave). Pretty sure that the burger I finally ended up with was the same patties from the first try so it was cold by the time I ate it. A waitress came to drop off some food and appeared to be eating something while telling us what order it was. Kind of gross. I'm not one to complain about food\/service typically (I was a waitress myself!), but this was one of my worst experiences at a restaurant ever. Luckily our food was comped, but even that had some miscommunication between the waiter and the manager as we had already paid for one meal so the waiter had to go get our money back.
