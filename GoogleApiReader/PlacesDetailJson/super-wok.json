Not bad. I'm used to them having a little more flavor at other places, but still good. The steamed dumplings were great, and the dipping sauce was perfection! I ordered through door dash and the food was ready and at my door in great time.\n\n*Edited to add\nWe ordered szechuan chicken and empress chicken.  The Szechuan had a little kick but not bad. However, it was fairly bland, as was the empress chicken. With all the bland foods we've had, I don't know how so many p\nrave about them. I'm sure we'll order again, simply because they're not far from my house. However, my go-to spot is still downtown. Peking Garden, hands down, is the best in C\/U.","time":1562112488},{"author_name":"Paula Shearer","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/114621018094994807136\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/-3wZ-Is49aTE\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/1oTtCgIkj8E\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Great meal on Super Bowl Sunday.","time":1581185852}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/?cid=17253808799368717347","user_ratings_total":74,"utc_offset":-300,"vicinity":"1737 West Kirby Avenue, Champaign","website":"http:\/\/www.gosuperwok.com\/"},"status":"OK"}
