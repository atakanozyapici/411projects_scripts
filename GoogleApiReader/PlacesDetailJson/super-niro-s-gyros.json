I like the surroundings, service is quick and attentive, but mainly, I just really like the food. The gyros are great, but I've gone low carb, so now I get the Super Niro Greek Salad and a side of gyro meat, and usually a Jerusalem salad as well. All great. Other items are good too, from stealing bites from the rest of the fam, but that's my go-to and it's wonderful. Food usually lasts me several days as leftovers too, so it gives me a good chance to get my gyros fix away from Chicagoland.","time":1514559494}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/?cid=4491225312462827657","user_ratings_total":535,"utc_offset":-300,"vicinity":"608 West Town Center Boulevard, Champaign","website":"https:\/\/superniros.com\/"},"status":"OK"}
