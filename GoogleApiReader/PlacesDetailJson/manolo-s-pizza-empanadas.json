When asked about it, she said it was because the store never gave her one. The pizza arrived 40 minutes earlier than it was supposed to, and it was almost raw. The dough was squishy and white, and some of the cheese wasn't even melted. The driver brought us a new pizza that was cooked better, and REFUSED to wear a mask yet again. It was a 50$ order and the tip was more than generous. I'll be reporting this to the health department.","time":1593302872},{"author_name":"Forrest Iandola","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/108513204382913049138\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/-A0ciPeShy7c\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/GMOrcZqB32g\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo\/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"I was last there a decade ago, but I just remembered about it and decided to leave a review.
