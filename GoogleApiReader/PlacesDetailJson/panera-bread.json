Food is fresh and not too processed, which is what we expect from a Panera.  This facility has a large seating area, a drive through, as well as a outside seating area open when weather is favorable.\n\nParking can be a little tricky during peak hours but there is large parking area in the adjoining block.\n\nI just wish that they had low-salt options.
