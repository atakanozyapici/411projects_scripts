I like the tonkotsu (pork bone) and sukiyaki (sweet soy) broths. My friend enjoyed the kimchi broth too. I think beef, pork, and lamb are all good choices. The plates of meat are quite small though. However, like most shabu shabu places, they include a bowl of vegetables to fill you up more. I don't really care about vegetables though because I'm unhealthy so I just order a lot of meat. This makes it expensive so it might just be more worth it to go to an AYCE hot pot place. The other place on campus I can think of is Red Cape, but because they are AYCE they're meat is not a fresh I'd say.\n\nI'd also order the tofu skin and fish balls. The boba here is also pretty good. I enjoyed the caramel black sugar tsaocaa special.","time":1573942430},{"author_name":"Deydis Red Dead Redemption 2","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/117720422892230773667\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/-zM5swofmZPA\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/UaiSVhrLN44\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Hot pot, fresh frozen meat and veggies.

Also the pork broth seems like plain pork stock and was very bland. \n\nEdit: second time coming here was much better. Surprisingly the fatty lamb wasn't fatty and was by far the best; the beef or seafood is also a good choice. Definitely recommend getting the spicy broth or kimchi, the pork broth was a little bland. Fish balls and fried tofu skin were also delicious. For the noodles definitely get the glass noodles or splurge for the udon. The think noodles seem like they're basically just spaghetti. If you order the right things the food's great but there are some mediocre choices. Originally rated 3 stars but I keep coming back since what they do well is worth it so raised to 5 stars.","time":1580377892}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/?cid=6096626389845070901","user_ratings_total":47,"utc_offset":-300,"vicinity":"608 South 6th Street, Champaign","website":"http:\/\/www.mitzutsaocaa.com\/"},"status":"OK"}
