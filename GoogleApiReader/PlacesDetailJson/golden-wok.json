The gentleman who may be the owner (I didn't ask) recommended a couple dishes for us to try as this was my first time. I must say, he has great taste in his own cooking.\n\nWe had coffee and tea with sugar and cream; Thai iced tea and Thai iced coffee, I believe they were called on the menu. Very tasty. The iced coffee was not so different than similar drinks in other restaurants, but it was better than average. The tea was a new experience for me. I had not had that blend of tea before, nor had I ever put cream  in tea before. Highly recommended.\n\nThe dishes were served on platters and came with more modest plates from which to eat and a bowl of steamed white rice. The servings were generous and the quality of the dishes was great.\n\nI had to get a tea to go just to leave a nice tip as I don't carry cash and you pay when you order. Also the tea is really good.\n\nI really can't say enough good about this lovely little restaurant.","time":1569548192},{"author_name":"Jonathan Booth","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/110779437732915329507\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/-ks7t0axr_l0\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/Vd594Ip2ws8\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"Tasty as always.
