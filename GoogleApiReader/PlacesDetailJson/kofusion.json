I typically order the spicy tuna roll but last time I ordered it was a little too spicy so this time I ordered the mild tuna. Once my order arrived, I noticed that the mild tuna just consisted of huge chunks of raw tuna and seaweed wrap. I called immediately and apologized, explaining that I made a mistake thinking this roll was the same as the spicy tuna but milder. The woman who answered the phone stated I got the wrong order and I could come pick up the mild tuna roll. I thanked her and confirmed all the ingredients I typically get in the spicy tuna roll. She placed me on hold and then another woman got on the phone stating that there was no mistake and what I received was a mild tuna roll. I explained the situation again and she said there was nothing they could do for me. I understand that I ordered the wrong roll but the customer service was harsh. There was no attempt to accommodate me in any way. Honestly, this hasn\u2019t been my first experience with this type of customer service at Kofusion but because of the quality of the food, I always return. Not anymore, this was very disappointing.","time":1590372046},{"author_name":"Todd Reddy","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/115581596943572577512\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/-CdXUd8vCDic\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/Ntu6WZ4elkE\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"The food is high quality and delicious.
