We ordered a variety of entrees and everything was delicious, from the steaks to the seafood to the side dishes.  The service was also wonderful.  Both the manager and the chef came to our table to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.  We visited during phase 4 of the Illinois COVID-19 recovery plan so the staff wore masks for safety.  I was impressed that EVERYONE took this seriously, meaning the masks were worn properly to cover both mouth and nose, not just hanging below the face for show!\n\nThis restaurant is a jewel in our community, providing a top level dining experience you might seek in Chicago or other large cities, and very affordable in comparison.","time":1595000974},{"author_name":"Brandy Emberton","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/104825119825931798009\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/-7FWqyx3AOs8\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/TPCmvUTec8Y\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Fantastic experience tonight.

One of my parents' favorite places to eat, and the chefs come out and talk to their patrons, and even with masks on, they recognized them and all said hello, while giving away steak chili Mac to signal their reopening during Covid19 shutdown. They are happy to get their Patio Time back end of month!
