I only had one piece of pizza, and I liked it (but haven't been here enough times to know how consistent this is). There were many different kinds of ready pizza slices to choose from, most of which I have never heard of. I chose a more typical mozzarella, basil, and tomato slice. They had macaroni and cheese, tortellini, chicken taco, etc. My daughter had the chicken taco pizza, and her friend had mushroom. They both liked their pizza.
