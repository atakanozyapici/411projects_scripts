Ramen was $14 and pretty good portion size (I'm a decently sized guy and was filled, and she is smaller and couldn't finish). The ramen itself was overly salty and not flavourful enough. The broth did not taste enough of pork, mainly salt. The pork was good, but the other toppings were lacking in quality. The people around us got gyoza, but neither group finished the order (nor took it with them), so that was telling as well.\n\nService was attentive and prompt.
