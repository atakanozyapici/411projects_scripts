Then we told our waiter it was their birthday in a couple of days and he said ok and gave us a thumbs up.  He brought out two little cupcakes, no hat, no sparklers as other tables and then in a couple minutes came to our table and said only one cake would be provided since we didn\u2019t spend $100 (we spent $72) and we\u2019d be charged for the second one.  Who does this anyway???  I just called and the manager said he would refund the money charged for cake even though that wasn\u2019t their policy.  Being treated rudely as we entered followed by cake issue definitely put a damper on our celebration.  Pretty certain we won\u2019t be rushing back any time soon.
