Firstly I do not recommend every going to Kung Fu BBQ, but if for some reason you are crazy enough to go, I recommend you bring a pillow and blanket because you will be waiting a long time.  I waited for 2 HOURS for my food to arrive, and wasn't even addressed by anyone at the restaurant until after 30 minutes of standing at the entrance.  FYI the food was also not the best.\n\nI wouldn't even be that mad about the 2 hrs wait and bad food if the restaurant management was at least kind and polite, but unfortunately they can't seem to do anything right.  They were extremely rude to my friends and I as well, which is why I'm having to write this review.
