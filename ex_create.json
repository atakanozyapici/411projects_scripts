It means a lot and since I work close by, I would visit again to see the changes.\n Original review: I haven't been to Za's since they closed the Springfield Ave location... I wasn't missing anything. I get that some businesses try less on campus, but this was even less effort than usual. The salad had over ripe apples and the lettuce that was going bad. The soup was watery. The garlic bread was small. And all for $9.50. There are too many other options on Green St.",
